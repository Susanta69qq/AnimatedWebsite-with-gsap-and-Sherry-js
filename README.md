This is an excellent project, if you are looking to learn about animated websites. Tools used to execute this project were Locomotive JS, Shery JS, and Gsap. This project is a must have, if you are looking to brush your animation skills. Please feel free to throw me your suggestions, if any.
Thank You!!!!
